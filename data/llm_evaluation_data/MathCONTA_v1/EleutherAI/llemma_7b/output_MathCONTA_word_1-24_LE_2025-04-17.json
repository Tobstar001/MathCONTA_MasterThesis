If you subtract the first number from the second one, you get 297. Find the first number. Let's think step by step.\nA: ## Solution: Let the first three-digit number be $x = 100a_x + 10b_x + 4.$.\\nThe reversed number is:$y = 100 \\\\cdot 4 + 10b_x + a_x = 400 + 10b_x + a_x.$\\n\\nAccording to the problem:\\n$x + y = 505.$\\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\\n$$(100a_x + 10b_x + 4) + (400 + 10b_x + a_x) = 505,$$$$101a_x + 20b_x + 404 = 505,$$$$101a_x + 20b_x = 101.$$\\n\\nBut we have also:\\n$$y - x = 297,$$$$(400 + 10b_x + a_x) - (100a_x + 10b_x + 4) = 297,$$$$396 - 99a_x = 297,$$$$99a_x = 99,$$$$a_x = 1.$$\\n\\nPlug in $a=1$ into the first equation:\\n$$101(1) + 20b_x = 101,$$$$20b_x = 0 \\\\implies b = 0.$$\\nThus, the first number is:$$x = 100(1) + 10(0) + 4 = 104.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{104}.\n\nQ: You buy 5 pounds of apples for $3.75.
