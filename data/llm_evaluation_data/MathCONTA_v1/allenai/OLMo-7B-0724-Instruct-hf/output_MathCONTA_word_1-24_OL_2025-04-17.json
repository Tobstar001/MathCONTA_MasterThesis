            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "## Solution: Let the first three-digit number be $x = 100a_x + 10b_x + 4.$.\\nThe reversed number is:$y = 100 \\\\cdot 4 + 10b_x + a_x = 400 + 10b_x + a_x.$\\n\\nAccording to the problem:\\n$x + y = 505.$\\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\\n$$(100a_x + 10b_x + 4) + (400 + 10b_x + a_x) = 505,$$$$101a_x + 20b_x + 404 = 505,$$$$101a_x + 20b_x = 101.$$\\n\\nBut we have also:\\n$$y - x = 297,$$$$(400 + 10b_x + a_x) - (100a_x + 10b_x + 4) = 297,$$$$396 - 99a_x = 297,$$$$99a_x = 99,$$$$a_x = 1.$$\\n\\nPlug in $a=1$ into the first equation:\\n$$101(1) + 20b_x = 101,$$$$20b_x = 0 \\\\implies b = 0.$$\\nThus, the first number is:$$x = 100(1) + 10(0) + 4 = 104.$$",
            "LLM_RESPONSE": "Let's call the three-digit number \"ABC\" (where A, B, and C are digits). We know that the units digit of A is 4.\n\n1. The sum of A and its reversed digits (AC) is 505: $$A + C5 = 505$$\n2. The difference of A and AC is 297: $$A - AC = 297$$\n\nLet's look at the units digit of A:\n\n* The units digit of A is 4.\n* The units digit of C5 is 5 (since C is the units digit).\n* The units digit of A + C5 is the same as the units digit of A (4).\n* The units digit of A - AC is the same as the units digit of A (4).\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of A:\n\n* If A is 4, then C5 is 5, and A + C5 is 9, which is not equal to 505.\n* If A is 5, then C5 is 0, and A + C5 is 5, which is not equal to 505.\n* If A is 6, then C5 is 1, and A + C5 is 17, which is not equal to 505.\n* If A is 7, then C5 is 4, and A + C5 is 19, which is not equal to 505.\n* If A is 8, then C5 is 0, and A + C5 is 8, which is not equal to 505.\n* If A is 9, then C5 is 1, and A + C5 is 19, which is not equal to 505.\n\nSo, the only possible value for A is 8.\n\nNow, let's find the value of C:\n\n* $$8 + C5 = 5$$\n* $$8 - 8C = 297$$\n\nWe can solve for C:\n\n* $$C = \\frac{297}{8C} = \\frac{297}{8c} = \\frac{9}{c}$$\n* $$C = \\boxed{1}$$\n\nSo, the three-digit number is 8C1, and its value is 8 + C1 = 8 + 1 = \\boxed{9}.<|endoftext|>",
