            "PROMPT": "Q: From an unlimited supply of $1$-cent coins, $10$-cent coins, and $25$-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called $\\textit{greedy algorithm}$, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N$. For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$-cent coin, then a $10$-cent coin, then $7$ $1$-cent coins. However, this collection of $9$ coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of $42$ cents; indeed, choosing $4$ $10$-cent coins and $2$ $1$-cent coins achieves the same total value with only $6$ coins.\\n\\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of $1$-cent, $10$-cent, and $25$-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds. Let's think step by step.\nA: ##Solution 1\\n\\nWe begin by noting that all values of $N \\\\leq 25$ work without issue.\\n\\nStarting from $N = 25$ to $29$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin, and no problem arises.\\n\\nFrom $N = 30$ to $34$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin along with $5$ $1$-cent coins to reach a total of $30$, while the optimal solution would involve using $3$ $10$-cent coins. This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$, as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$-cent coins to match the optimal solution.\\n\\nFrom $N = 40$ to $44$, a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$-cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$-cent coins.\\n\\nThe problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$, where $50 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \\\\times 10$, and it is resolved at $N = 60$. From $N = 65$ to $69$, a similar issue arises, as $25 \\\\times 2 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \\\\times 10$ to approach 65.\\n\\nWe observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$, and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$, then $80$, and so on, continuing until $980$\u2013$1005$ for the last cycle.\\n\\nThe total number of cycles is given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,$$\\n\\nand each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:\\n\\n$$38 \\\\times 10 = 380.$$\\n\\nThe cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$, giving another $10$ problematic numbers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$, and the desired count of successful numbers is:\\n\\n$$1000 - 390 = \\\\boxed{610}.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{610}.\n\nQ: Let $S$ be the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ with $1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 100$ and $b \\\\geq 0$ such that the polynomial $x^2+ax+b$ can be factored into the product of two (not necessarily distinct) linear factors with integer coefficients.

Also note that there is no overlap between the two situations! This is because if they overlapped, adding the two equations of both cases and canceling out gives you $a=d$, which cannot be true.\\n\\nCase 1. This is probably the simplest: just make a list of possible combinations for $\\\\{a, b\\\\}$ and $\\\\{c, d\\\\}$. We get $\\\\{1, 15\\\\}\\\\dots\\\\{7, 9\\\\}$ for the first and $\\\\{4, 20\\\\}\\\\dots\\\\{11, 13\\\\}$ for the second. That appears to give us $7*8=56$ solutions, right? NO.

We find $\\\\{4, 12, 20, ?\\\\}$, and likewise up to $a=15$. But we can\\'t have $a=8$ or $a=12$ because $a=b$ or $a=c$, respectively! Now, it would seem like there are $10$ values for $a$ and $17$ unique values for each $?$, giving a total of $170$, but that is once again not true because there are some repeated values!

Therefore, we can break it up into cases and let the last digit be either $2, 4, 6,$ or $8$.

Denote the odd numbered positions to be $a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7$ and the even numbered positions to be $a_2, a_4, a_6$ (recall $a_8=2$). By the divisibility rule of $11$, we must have:$$(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + 2)$$which is congruent to $0\\\\hspace{2mm}(\\\\text{mod}\\\\hspace{1mm}11)$.

            "LLM_RESPONSE": "## Solution\\n\\nWe can think of this problem as a permutation with restrictions. We have twelve letters, and we want to choose two at a time, but we have to be careful. We can't choose $A$ and $B$, for example, because they would be the same letter. So we have to choose $10$ pairs of letters, and then we can arrange them in alphabetical order. We can do this in $10!$ ways.\\n\\nNow, we want to find the number of ways that the last word contains $G$. We can do this by finding the number of ways that the last word does not contain $G$, and subtracting that from the total number of ways. We can find the number of ways that the last word does not contain $G$ by finding the number of ways that $G$ is in the first six words, and subtracting that from the total number of ways.\\n\\nIf $G$ is in the first six words, then the last word must be $G$. So we have $6$ ways that $G$ is in the first six words, and $1$ way that $G$ is not in the first six words. So the number of ways that the last word does not contain $G$ is $10!-6$.\\n\\nSo the probability that the last word contains $G$ is $\\\\frac{10!-6}{10!} = \\\\frac{10!-6}{10!}$, and $10!-6+10 = \\\\boxed{1018}$.\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1018}.\n\nQ: Let $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}$ be a sequence of integers such that for any pair of distinct terms $a_i$ and $a_j$, there exists another term $a_k$ for which $a_i + a_j = 2a_k$.

Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$.\\n\\n Let's think step by step.\nA: ## Solution\\n\\nYou let the linear factors be as $(x+c)(x+d)$.\\n\\nThen, obviously $a=c+d$ and $b=cd$.\\n\\nWe know that $1\\\\le a\\\\le 100$ and $b\\\\ge 0$, so $c$ and $d$ both have to be non-negative\\n\\nHowever, $a$ cannot be $0$, so at least one of $c$ and $d$ must be greater than $0$, ie positive.\\n\\nAlso, $a$ cannot be greater than $100$, so $c+d$ must be less than or equal to $100$.\\n\\nEssentially, if we plot the solutions, we get a triangle on the coordinate plane with vertices $(0,0), (0, 100),$ and $(100,0)$. Remember that $(0,0)$ does not work, so there is a square with top right corner $(1,1)$.\\n\\nNote that $c$ and $d$ are interchangeable, since they end up as $a$ and $b$ in the end anyways. Thus, we simply draw a line from $(1,1)$ to $(50,50)$, designating one of the halves as our solution (since the other side is simply the coordinates flipped).\\n\\nWe note that the pattern from $(1,1)$ to $(50,50)$ is $2+3+4+\\\\dots+51$ solutions and from $(51, 49)$ to $(100,0)$ is $50+49+48+\\\\dots+1$ solutions, since we can decrease the $y$-value by $1$ until $0$ for each coordinate.\\n\\nAdding up gives $$\\\\dfrac{2+51}{2}\\\\cdot 50+\\\\dfrac{50+1}{2}\\\\cdot 50.$$ This gives us $2600$, and $2600\\\\equiv 600 \\\\bmod{1000}.$\\n\\nThus, the answer is: $$\\\\boxed{600}.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{600}.\n\nQ: From an unlimited supply of $1$-cent coins, $10$-cent coins, and $25$-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer.

This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$, as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$-cent coins to match the optimal solution.\\n\\nFrom $N = 40$ to $44$, a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$-cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$-cent coins.\\n\\nThe problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$, where $50 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \\\\times 10$, and it is resolved at $N = 60$. From $N = 65$ to $69$, a similar issue arises, as $25 \\\\times 2 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \\\\times 10$ to approach 65.\\n\\nWe observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$, and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$, then $80$, and so on, continuing until $980$\u2013$1005$ for the last cycle.\\n\\nThe total number of cycles is given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,$$\\n\\nand each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:\\n\\n$$38 \\\\times 10 = 380.$$\\n\\nThe cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$, giving another $10$ problematic numbers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$, and the desired count of successful numbers is:\\n\\n$$1000 - 390 = \\\\boxed{610}.$$",
