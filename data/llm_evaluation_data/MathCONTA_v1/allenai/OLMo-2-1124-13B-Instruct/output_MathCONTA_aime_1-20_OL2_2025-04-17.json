He uses the so-called $\\textit{greedy algorithm}$, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N$. For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$-cent coin, then a $10$-cent coin, then $7$ $1$-cent coins. However, this collection of $9$ coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of $42$ cents; indeed, choosing $4$ $10$-cent coins and $2$ $1$-cent coins achieves the same total value with only $6$ coins.\\n\\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of $1$-cent, $10$-cent, and $25$-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed\n<|assistant|>\n##Solution 1\\n\\nWe begin by noting that all values of $N \\\\leq 25$ work without issue.\\n\\nStarting from $N = 25$ to $29$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin, and no problem arises.\\n\\nFrom $N = 30$ to $34$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin along with $5$ $1$-cent coins to reach a total of $30$, while the optimal solution would involve using $3$ $10$-cent coins. This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$, as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$-cent coins to match the optimal solution.\\n\\nFrom $N = 40$ to $44$, a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$-cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$-cent coins.\\n\\nThe problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$, where $50 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \\\\times 10$, and it is resolved at $N = 60$. From $N = 65$ to $69$, a similar issue arises, as $25 \\\\times 2 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \\\\times 10$ to approach 65.\\n\\nWe observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$, and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$, then $80$, and so on, continuing until $980$\u2013$1005$ for the last cycle.\\n\\nThe total number of cycles is given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,$$\\n\\nand each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:\\n\\n$$38 \\\\times 10 = 380.$$\\n\\nThe cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$, giving another $10$ problematic numbers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$, and the desired count of successful numbers is:\\n\\n$$1000 - 390 = \\\\boxed{610}.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{610}.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nLet $S$ be the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ with $1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 100$ and $b \\\\geq 0$ such that the polynomial $x^2+ax+b$ can be factored into the product of two (not necessarily distinct) linear factors with integer coefficients.

Each base is a regular hexagon with side length \\(1\\), and the height of the prism is \\(2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Total Number of Triangles\n\nThe prism has \\(12\\) vertices. Any \\(3\\) vertices determine a triangle. The total number of ways to choose \\(3\\) vertices out of \\(12\\) is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{12}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Isosceles Triangles\n\nAn isosceles triangle has at least two sides of equal length. In this context, we need to consider the following cases for isosceles triangles:\n\n#### Case 1: Two sides are equal and the third side is different\n\n**Subcase 1.1:** Two sides are edges of the hexagon, and the third side is a height of the prism.\n\nEach hexagon has \\(6\\) edges. The number of ways to choose \\(2\\) edges out of \\(6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nFor each pair of edges, there are \\(2\\) heights (one in each direction) that can serve as the third side of the triangle. Thus, there are \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\) triangles in this subcase.\n\n**Subcase 1.2:** Two sides are heights of the prism, and the third side is an edge of the hexagon.\n\nThere are \\(6\\) edges in the hexagon. For each edge, there are \\(2\\) pairs of heights that can form a triangle with it. Thus, there are \\(6 \\times 2 = 12\\) triangles in this subcase.\n\n#### Case 2: All three sides are equal (equilateral triangle)\n\nAn equilateral triangle can be formed by connecting any vertex to two adjacent vertices on the same base or on different bases. Each base has \\(6\\) vertices, and there are \\(2\\) bases.\n\n**Subcase 2.1:** Equilateral triangles on the same base.\n\nFor each base, the number of equilateral triangles formed by connecting adjacent vertices is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Since there are \\(2\\) bases, this gives \\(20 \\times 2 = 40\\) equilateral triangles.\n\n**Subcase 2.2:** Equilateral triangles connecting vertices from different bases.\n\nEach vertex on one base can connect to exactly one vertex on the other base to form an equilateral triangle. Since there are \\(6\\) vertices on each base, this gives \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) equilateral triangles.\n\n### Step 4: Summing Up\n\nAdding all the cases together:\n\n- Subcase 1.1: \\(30\\) triangles\n- Subcase 1.2: \\(12\\) triangles\n- Case 2.1: \\(40\\) triangles\n- Case 2.2: \\(36\\) triangles\n\nTotal number of isosceles triangles:\n\n\\[\n30 + 12 + 40 + 36 = 118\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe number of isosceles triangles (including equilateral triangles) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{118}\n\\]<|endoftext|>",

We can count the number of left/right (L/R) paths of length $\\\\le 11$ that start at $S$ and end at either $P_4$ or $P_3$.\\n\\nWe can visualize the paths using the common grid counting method by starting at the origin $(0,0)$, so that a right (R) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $x$ direction, and a left (L) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $y$ direction. Because we don't want to move more than 2 units left or more than 3 units right, our path must not cross the lines $y = x+2$ or $y = x-3$.

We can start from \\( b = 10 \\) and check upwards.\n\n#### Testing \\( b = 10 \\):\n\n- \\( 17_{10} = 17 \\)\n- \\( 97_{10} = 97 \\)\n\n\\( 97 \\div 17 = 5 \\) (integer quotient)\n\nThus, \\( b = 10 \\) works.\n\n#### Testing \\( b = 11 \\):\n\n- \\( 17_{11} = 16 + 1 = 17 \\)\n- \\( 97_{11} = 8 \\cdot 11 + 7 = 97 \\)\n\n\\( 97 \\div 17 = 5 \\) (integer quotient)\n\nThus, \\( b = 11 \\) works.\n\n#### Testing \\( b = 12 \\):\n\n- \\( 17_{12} = 15 + 2 = 17 \\)\n- \\( 97_{12} = 8 \\cdot 12 + 7 = 97 \\)\n\n\\( 97 \\div 17 = 5 \\) (integer quotient)\n\nThus, \\( b = 12 \\) works.\n\n### Step 7: Generalizing and Summing Up\n\nWe observe that for \\( b \\geq 10 \\), \\( 17_b \\) divides \\( 97_b \\) because \\( 97_b \\) always evaluates to \\( 97 \\) in decimal, and \\( 17 \\) is a divisor of \\( 97 \\).\n\nThus, all bases \\( b > 9 \\) work. The smallest base greater than 9 is 10, and there is no upper limit given in the problem, so we consider all bases \\( b \\geq 10 \\).\n\nThe sum of all integer bases \\( b \\) starting from 10 is an infinite series starting from 10. However, since the problem asks for the sum of all such bases, and we've established that all bases \\( b > 9 \\) work, we consider the smallest starting point.\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of the series starting from 10 is:\n\n\\[ S_n = 10 + 11 + 12 + \\ldots + (10 + k) \\]\n\nFor \\( k \\) large enough to cover all bases \\( b > 9 \\), the sum grows indefinitely. However, since the problem asks for the remainder when divided by 1000, we focus on the initial terms.\n\nThe sum of the first few terms (10, 11, 12) is:\n\n\\[ 10 + 11 + 12 = 33 \\]\n\nThus, the remainder when 33 is divided by 1000 is:\n\n\\[ 33 \\mod 1000 = 33 \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)<|endoftext|>",

Each player chooses one of three flavors: chocolate (C), vanilla (V), or strawberry (S).\n2. At least one player chooses each flavor.\n3. The number of players who chose chocolate (C) is greater than those who chose vanilla (V), which in turn is greater than those who chose strawberry (S).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Label Players:** Let \\( C \\) be the number of players who chose chocolate, \\( V \\) for vanilla, and \\( S \\) for strawberry. We have \\( C > V > S \\) and \\( C + V + S = 9 \\).\n\n2. **Possible Values:** Since \\( C, V, S \\) are positive integers and \\( C > V > S \\), we can start by assigning the smallest possible values to \\( S \\) and \\( V \\) while ensuring \\( C \\) remains greater.\n\n3. **Trial and Error with Constraints:**\n   - Start with \\( S = 1 \\). Then \\( V \\) must be at least 2 (since \\( V > S \\)), and \\( C \\) must be at least 3 (since \\( C > V \\)).\n   - This gives us \\( C + V + S = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \\), which is less than 9.

            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "##Solution 1\\n\\nNote that order does not matter here. This is because any permutation of the $6$ pairs will automatically get ordered in alphabetical order. The same is true for within each of the pairs. In other words, AB CH DI EJ FK GL should be counted equally as HC AB DI EJ FK GL.\\n\\nWe construct two cases: $G$ is the first letter of the last word and $G$ is the second letter of the last word.\\n\\nOur first case is when $G$ is the first letter of the last word. Then the second letter of the last word must be one of $H, I, J, K, L$. Call that set of $5$ letters $\\\\Omega$. There are $5$ ways to choose the second letter from $\\\\Omega$. The other $4$ letters of $\\\\Omega$ must be used in the other $5$ words.\\n\\nFor the other 5 words, each of their first letters must be before $G$ in the alphabet. Otherwise, the word with $G$ will not be the last. There are $6$ letters before $G$: $A,B,C,D,E,F$. Call that set of $6$ letters $\\\\Sigma$. Exactly one of the words must have two letters from $\\\\Sigma$. The other 4 will have their first letter from $\\\\Sigma$ and the second letter from $\\\\Omega$. There are $4!$ ways to determine the possible pairings of letters from $\\\\Sigma$ and $\\\\Omega$, respectively.\\n\\nTherefore, this case has $5 \\\\cdot {6\\\\choose{2}} \\\\cdot 4! = 5 \\\\cdot 15 \\\\cdot 24 = 1800$ orderings.\\n\\nThe second case is when $G$ is the second letter of the last word. You can see that the first letter of that word must be $F$. Otherwise, that word cannot be the last word. The other $5$ words must start with $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The second letter of each of those words will come from $\\\\Omega$. There will be $5!$ ways to distribute the elements of $\\\\Omega$ to one of $A, B, C, D, E$. There are therefore $5! = 120$ orderings in the case.\\n\\nIn total, there are $1800+120 = 1920$ orderings. However, we want the probability. The number of ways to put the $12$ letters into pairs is $11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1$. This is true because we can say this: Start with $A$. It has $11$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $10$ letters left. Pick one of those letters. It has $9$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $8$ letters left. Continue until there are only $2$ letters left, and there is only $1$ option for that last word. Therefore, there will be $11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1$ options.\\n\\nThe probability is therefore $\\\\frac{1920}{11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1} = \\\\frac{128}{693}$. The requested answer is $128 + 693 = \\\\boxed{821}$.\\n\\n",
            "LLM_RESPONSE": "To determine the probability that the last word listed contains the letter 'G', we need to consider the arrangement of the pairs and their alphabetical order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Total Arrangements**: First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange the six pairs alphabetically. Since each pair is already ordered, we only need to consider the order of these six pairs. The number of ways to arrange 6 pairs is \\(6!\\).\n\n2. **Desired Arrangement**: We want the last word to be 'G' followed by another letter. For 'G' to be the last letter in the final word, 'G' must be in the last pair. There are 6 positions for 'G' to be in (since it can be paired with any of the other 11 letters).\n\n3. **Valid Arrangements for 'G' in the Last Position**: Once 'G' is fixed in the last position, we need to arrange the remaining 5 pairs alphabetically. The number of ways to arrange these 5 pairs is \\(5!\\).\n\n4. **Total Favorable Outcomes**: Multiply the number of ways to choose the pair for 'G' (11 choices) by the number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 pairs (5!): \\(11 \\times 5!\\).\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability \\(P\\) is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{11 \\times 5!}{6!}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the Fraction**: Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{11 \\times 120}{720} = \\frac{1320}{720} = \\frac{11}{6}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Relatively Prime \\(m\\) and \\(n\\)**: Here, \\(m = 11\\) and \\(n = 6\\).

            "LLM_RESPONSE": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions for the system of equations involving complex numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the first equation\n\nThe first equation is:\n\\[ |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \\]\n\nThis represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \\(25 - 20i\\) with a radius of 5. The equation of this circle can be written as:\n\\[ (z - (25 - 20i))^2 = 25 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second equation\n\nThe second equation is:\n\\[ |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \\]\n\nThis represents a condition where the distance from \\(z\\) to \\(4 + k\\) is equal to the distance from \\(z\\) to \\(3i + k\\). This implies that \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\) are equidistant from \\(z\\), meaning \\(z\\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the geometric implications\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of a line segment in the complex plane is the line that passes through the midpoint of the segment and is perpendicular to it. The midpoint \\(M\\) of the segment joining \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\) is:\n\\[ M = \\left( \\frac{4 + k + 3i}{2}, \\frac{4 + k + 3i}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{4 + 3i + k}{2}, \\frac{4 + k + 3i}{2} \\right) \\]\n\nThe slope of the line segment joining \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{slope} = \\frac{3i - (k - 4)}{0 - (1)} = \\frac{3i + 4 - k}{-1} = -3i - (4 - k) \\]\n\nThe slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal:\n\\[ \\text{slope}_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{-3i - (4 - k)} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(z\\)\n\nFor \\(z\\) to satisfy both conditions, it must lie on the circle and on the perpendicular bisector. The intersection of these two conditions gives us the specific \\(z\\) that satisfies the system.\n\n### Step 5: Determine \\(k\\)\n\nThe key insight is that for the system to have exactly one solution, the circle must intersect the perpendicular bisector at exactly one point. This happens when the distance between \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\) is such that the circle of radius 5 centered at \\(25 - 20i\\) just touches the perpendicular bisector.\n\nThe distance between \\(4 + k\\) and \\(3i + k\\) is:\n\\[ |(4 + k) - (3i + k)| = |4 - 3i| = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = 5 \\]\n\nThus, \\(k\\) must be such that the circle \\( |z - (25 - 20i)| = 5 \\) intersects the line \\( \\text{slope}_{\\perp} \\) at exactly one point.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate \\(k\\)\n\nGiven the symmetry and the specific geometric configuration, \\(k\\) must be such that the circle and the bisector meet at a single point. This happens when \\(k\\) is chosen such that the perpendicular bisector passes through the circle's boundary.\n\nAfter careful geometric analysis and algebraic manipulation, it turns out that \\(k\\) must be \\(0\\) for the system to have exactly one solution. This is because \\(k = 0\\) simplifies the second condition to \\( |z - 4| = |z - 3i| \\), which is a line passing through the origin and symmetrically positioned relative to the circle.\n\n### Step 7: Sum of all possible values of \\(k\\)\n\nSince \\(k = 0\\) is the only value that ensures exactly one solution, the sum of all possible values of \\(k\\) is simply \\(0\\).\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0 \\).\n\nThe sum \\(m + n = 0 + 1 = 1\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1}.<|endoftext|>",

Thus, we simply draw a line from $(1,1)$ to $(50,50)$, designating one of the halves as our solution (since the other side is simply the coordinates flipped).\\n\\nWe note that the pattern from $(1,1)$ to $(50,50)$ is $2+3+4+\\\\dots+51$ solutions and from $(51, 49)$ to $(100,0)$ is $50+49+48+\\\\dots+1$ solutions, since we can decrease the $y$-value by $1$ until $0$ for each coordinate.\\n\\nAdding up gives $$\\\\dfrac{2+51}{2}\\\\cdot 50+\\\\dfrac{50+1}{2}\\\\cdot 50.$$ This gives us $2600$, and $2600\\\\equiv 600 \\\\bmod{1000}.$\\n\\nThus, the answer is: $$\\\\boxed{600}.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{600}.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nFrom an unlimited supply of $1$-cent coins, $10$-cent coins, and $25$-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called $\\textit{greedy algorithm}$, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N$. For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$-cent coin, then a $10$-cent coin, then $7$ $1$-cent coins. However, this collection of $9$ coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of $42$ cents; indeed, choosing $4$ $10$-cent coins and $2$ $1$-cent coins achieves the same total value with only $6$ coins.\\n\\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of $1$-cent, $10$-cent, and $25$-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed\n<|assistant|>\n",

            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "##Solution 1\\n\\nWe begin by noting that all values of $N \\\\leq 25$ work without issue.\\n\\nStarting from $N = 25$ to $29$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin, and no problem arises.\\n\\nFrom $N = 30$ to $34$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin along with $5$ $1$-cent coins to reach a total of $30$, while the optimal solution would involve using $3$ $10$-cent coins. This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$, as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$-cent coins to match the optimal solution.\\n\\nFrom $N = 40$ to $44$, a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$-cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$-cent coins.\\n\\nThe problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$, where $50 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \\\\times 10$, and it is resolved at $N = 60$. From $N = 65$ to $69$, a similar issue arises, as $25 \\\\times 2 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \\\\times 10$ to approach 65.\\n\\nWe observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$, and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$, then $80$, and so on, continuing until $980$\u2013$1005$ for the last cycle.\\n\\nThe total number of cycles is given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,$$\\n\\nand each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:\\n\\n$$38 \\\\times 10 = 380.$$\\n\\nThe cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$, giving another $10$ problematic numbers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$, and the desired count of successful numbers is:\\n\\n$$1000 - 390 = \\\\boxed{610}.$$",
            "LLM_RESPONSE": "The greedy algorithm for this problem works by always choosing the largest denomination coin that does not exceed the remaining amount needed to reach \\(N\\) cents. The key to understanding when this algorithm fails is recognizing situations where choosing a larger coin would force us to use more coins overall.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Greedy Algorithm Success Criteria:**\n   - The greedy algorithm succeeds if, for every \\(N\\) from 1 to 1000, the sequence of coin choices given by the algorithm results in the minimum number of coins possible to achieve \\(N\\) cents.\n\n2. **Behavior of the Greedy Algorithm:**\n   - It starts with the largest coin (25 cents), then moves to the next largest (10 cents), and finally uses 1-cent coins to make up the remainder.\n\n3. **Failure Points:**\n   - The algorithm fails when using a 25-cent coin would force us to use more coins overall than a different strategy. This typically happens when \\(N\\) is close to a multiple of 25 but not enough to use another 25-cent coin without exceeding \\(N\\).\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - For \\(N\\) to be a failure point, \\(N\\) must be such that using a 25-cent coin would require more than one coin (i.e., \\(N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\\)), or it would be better to use a combination of 10-cent and 1-cent coins.\n\n5. **Counting Successful \\(N\\) Values:**\n   - We need to count the values of \\(N\\) from 1 to 1000 for which the greedy algorithm does not fail. This means \\(N\\) should not be of the form \\(25k + 1\\) for \\(k \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- **Total values from 1 to 1000:** \\(1000\\)\n- **Values of \\(N\\) of the form \\(25k + 1\\):** These are the potential failure points.\n  - The sequence \\(25, 50, 75, \\ldots, 975\\) gives us \\(40\\) terms (since \\(1000/25 = 40\\)).\n\nThus, the number of successful \\(N\\) values is \\(1000 - 40 = 960\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of values of \\(N\\) between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds is \\(\\boxed{960}\\).<|endoftext|>",
