            "LLM_RESPONSE": " Let's denote the three-digit number as $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are its digits. We know that $c = 4$ because the problem states that the units digit of the number is 4.\n\nThe number formed by reversing the digits of $abc$ is $cba$. So, $cba = 100c + 10b + a = 100 \\cdot 4 + 10b + a = 400 + 10b + a$.\n\nAccording to the problem, we have two equations:\n\n1. $abc + cba = 505$, which simplifies to $100a + 10b + 4 + 400 + 10b + a = 505$, or $101a + 20b = 951$.\n2. $cba - abc = 297$, which simplifies to $400 + 10b + a - (100a + 10b + 4) = 297$, or $99a = 293$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $a = \\frac{293}{99}$, which is not an integer. This means that our initial assumption that $c = 4$ was incorrect. Therefore, we need to try another value for $c$.\n\nLet's try $c = 3$. Then, $cba = 100c + 10b + a = 100 \\cdot 3 + 10b + a = 300 + 10b + a$.\n\nNow, we have two new equations:\n\n1. $abc + cba = 505$, which simplifies to $100a + 10b + 3 + 300 + 10b + a = 505$, or $101a + 20b = 172$.\n2. $cba - abc = 297$, which simplifies to $300 + 10b + a - (100a + 10b + 3) = 297$, or $99a = 294$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $a = \\frac{294}{99}$, which simplifies to $a = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 3$ into the first equation, we get $101 \\cdot 3 + 20b = 172$, which simplifies to $303 + 20b = 172$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{172 - 303}{20} = -1$.\n\nSince $b$ cannot be negative, we have made an incorrect assumption. Therefore, the units digit of the three-digit number cannot be 3.\n\nLet's try $c = 2$. Then, $cba = 100c + 10b + a = 100 \\cdot 2 + 10b + a = 200 + 10b + a$.\n\nNow, we have two new equations:\n\n1. $abc + cba = 505$, which simplifies to $100a + 10b + 2 + 200 + 10b + a = 505$, or $101a + 20b = 103$.\n2. $cba - abc = 297$, which simplifies to $200 + 10b + a - (100a + 10b + 2) = 297$, or $99a = 295$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $a = \\frac{295}{99}$, which is not an integer. This means that our initial assumption that $c = 2$ was incorrect. Therefore, the units digit of the three-digit number cannot be 2.\n\nLet's try $c = 1$. Then, $cba = 100c + 10b + a = 100 \\cdot 1 + 10b + a = 100 + 10b + a$.\n\nNow, we have two new equations:\n\n1. $abc + cba = 505$, which simplifies to $100a + 10b + 1 + 100 + 10b + a = 505$, or $101a + 20b = 304$.\n2. $cba - abc = 297$, which simplifies to $100 + 10b + a - (100a + 10b + 1) = 297$, or $99a = 296$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $a = \\frac{296}{99}$, which simplifies to $a = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 3$ into the first equation, we get $101 \\cdot 3 + 20b = 304$, which simplifies to $303 + 20b = 304$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{304 - 303}{20} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n\nSince $b$ cannot be a fraction, we have made an incorrect assumption. Therefore, the units digit of the three-digit number cannot be 1.\n\nLet's try $c = 0$. Then, $cba = 100c + 10b + a = 100 \\cdot 0 + 10b + a = 10b + a$.\n\nNow, we have two new equations:\n\n1. $abc + cba = 505$, which simplifies to $100a + 10b + 0 + 10b + a = 505$, or $101a + 20b = 505$.\n2. $cba - abc = 297$, which simplifies to $10b + a - (100a + 10b) = 297$, or $99a = 297$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $a = \\frac{297}{99}$, which simplifies to $a = 3$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 3$ into the first equation, we get $101 \\cdot 3 + 20b = 505$, which simplifies to $303 + 20b = 505$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{505 - 303}{20} = 10$.\n\nSince $b$ is a whole number, our assumption that $c = 0$ is correct. Therefore, the three-digit number is $abc = 314$.\n\nSo, the first number is $\\boxed{314}$.<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>",
