Each path starts at the bottom of the grid and ends at the top, always moving one unit northeast or northwest. She computes the area of the region between each path and the right side of the grid. What is the sum of the areas determined by all possible paths?\\n\\n$\\\\textbf{(A)}\\\\ 2520 \\\\qquad \\\\textbf{(B)}\\\\ 3150 \\\\qquad \\\\textbf{(C)}\\\\ 3840 \\\\qquad \\\\textbf{(D)}\\\\ 4730 \\\\qquad \\\\textbf{(E)}\\\\ 5050$\\n\\n Let's think step by step.\nA: ##Solution 1\\n\\nStep 1: To find the total number of paths, observe that all paths will have $10$ total steps. We have to choose which $5$ of these steps will be NE (the rest will be NW). So the total number of paths is $\\\\binom{10}{5}$. The formula for combinations is: $\\\\binom{n}{r} = \\\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ and $\\\\binom{10}{5} = \\\\frac{10!}{5!\\\\times5!}=252$.\\n\\nStep 2: Each path splits the total area of $25$ in two parts. So, for any path that gives $area = A$, you can find a unique \u2018sister\u2019 path that has an $area = 25-A$ (in other words, the pair of paths have a combined area of 25). Possible ways to define the \u2018sister\u2019 path are:\\n\\nRotate the entire grid $180^{\\\\circ}$\\nSwap each step of the original paths (for example, each NW becomes NE) (this is a reflection over the diagonal)\\nStep 3: There are a few ways to get from this observation to the total area:\\n\\nThere are $252/2 = 126$ pairs of such paths, and the total area of each pair is $25$. So the total area given by all paths is $126 \\\\times 25$.\\nEach of the $252$ paths gives an area of $25$ if you also count the \u2018sister\u2019 paths. Since each \u2018sister\u2019 path is also one of the $252$, you have to divide by $2$ to avoid double counting. So the total area given by all paths is $\\\\frac{252 \\\\times 25}{2}$.\\n\\nNote that the average area of two \u2018sister\u2019 paths is $\\\\frac{25}{2}$, so you can think about every path having this area on average. So the total area given by all paths is $252 \\\\times \\\\frac{25}{2}$.\\n\\nThe final answer is $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(B)}~3150}.$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{3150 / B}.\n\nQ: How many positive factors of 36 are also multiples of 4?\\n\\n$\\\\text{(A)}\\\\ 2 \\\\qquad \\\\text{(B)}\\\\ 3 \\\\qquad \\\\text{(C)}\\\\ 4 \\\\qquad \\\\text{(D)}\\\\ 5 \\\\qquad \\\\text{(E)}\\\\ 6$\\n\\n Let's think step by step.\nA:",

Cup $B$ has a sum of $6$, but we are told that it already has a $3$ slip, leaving $6-3=3$, which is too small for the $3.5$ slip. Cup $C$ is a little bit trickier, but still manageable. It must have a value of $7$, so adding the $3.5$ slip leaves room for $7-3.5=3.5$. This looks good at first, as we do have slips smaller than that, but upon closer inspection, we see that no slip fits exactly, and the smallest sum of two slips is $2+2=4$, which is too big, so this case is also impossible.

            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "##Solution 1\\n\\nLet $a$ be the length of the shorter base, and let $b$ be the length of the longer one. Note that these two parameters, along with the angle measures and the fact that the trapezoid is isosceles, uniquely determine a trapezoid. We drop perpendiculars down from the endpoints of the top base. Then the length from the foot of this perpendicular to either vertex will be half the difference between the lengths of the two bases, or $\\\\frac{b-a}{2}$. Now, since we have a 30-60-90 triangle and this side length corresponds to the \"30\" part, the length of the hypotenuse (one of the legs) is $2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{b-a}{2} = b-a$. Then the perimeter of the trapezoid is $2(b-a)+a+b=3b-a=30$. The only other stipulation for this trapezoid to be valid is that $b>a$ (which was our assumption). We can now easily count the valid pairs $(a,b)$, yielding $(3,11),(6,12),(9,13),(12,14)$. It is clear that proceeding further would cause $a \\\\geq b$, so we have $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(E)}~4}$ valid trapezoids.",

            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "##Solution 1\\n\\nStep 1: To find the total number of paths, observe that all paths will have $10$ total steps. We have to choose which $5$ of these steps will be NE (the rest will be NW). So the total number of paths is $\\\\binom{10}{5}$. The formula for combinations is: $\\\\binom{n}{r} = \\\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ and $\\\\binom{10}{5} = \\\\frac{10!}{5!\\\\times5!}=252$.\\n\\nStep 2: Each path splits the total area of $25$ in two parts. So, for any path that gives $area = A$, you can find a unique \u2018sister\u2019 path that has an $area = 25-A$ (in other words, the pair of paths have a combined area of 25). Possible ways to define the \u2018sister\u2019 path are:\\n\\nRotate the entire grid $180^{\\\\circ}$\\nSwap each step of the original paths (for example, each NW becomes NE) (this is a reflection over the diagonal)\\nStep 3: There are a few ways to get from this observation to the total area:\\n\\nThere are $252/2 = 126$ pairs of such paths, and the total area of each pair is $25$. So the total area given by all paths is $126 \\\\times 25$.\\nEach of the $252$ paths gives an area of $25$ if you also count the \u2018sister\u2019 paths. Since each \u2018sister\u2019 path is also one of the $252$, you have to divide by $2$ to avoid double counting. So the total area given by all paths is $\\\\frac{252 \\\\times 25}{2}$.\\n\\nNote that the average area of two \u2018sister\u2019 paths is $\\\\frac{25}{2}$, so you can think about every path having this area on average. So the total area given by all paths is $252 \\\\times \\\\frac{25}{2}$.\\n\\nThe final answer is $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(B)}~3150}.$",
