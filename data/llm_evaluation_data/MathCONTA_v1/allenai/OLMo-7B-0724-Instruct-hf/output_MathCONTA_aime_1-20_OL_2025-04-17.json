            "PROMPT": "<|endoftext|><|user|>\nFrom an unlimited supply of $1$-cent coins, $10$-cent coins, and $25$-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called $\\textit{greedy algorithm}$, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N$. For example, to get $42$ cents, Silas will choose a $25$-cent coin, then a $10$-cent coin, then $7$ $1$-cent coins. However, this collection of $9$ coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of $42$ cents; indeed, choosing $4$ $10$-cent coins and $2$ $1$-cent coins achieves the same total value with only $6$ coins.\\n\\nIn general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of $1$-cent, $10$-cent, and $25$-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed\n<|assistant|>\n##Solution 1\\n\\nWe begin by noting that all values of $N \\\\leq 25$ work without issue.\\n\\nStarting from $N = 25$ to $29$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin, and no problem arises.\\n\\nFrom $N = 30$ to $34$, the greedy algorithm will select the $25$-cent coin along with $5$ $1$-cent coins to reach a total of $30$, while the optimal solution would involve using $3$ $10$-cent coins. This issue is resolved from $N = 35$ to $39$, as the greedy algorithm can now select $25 + 10$-cent coins to match the optimal solution.\\n\\nFrom $N = 40$ to $44$, a similar problem occurs again. The greedy algorithm selects $25 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$-cent coins to reach 40, while the optimal solution would use 4 $10$-cent coins.\\n\\nThe problem occurs again from $N = 55$ to $59$, where $50 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as good as using $25 + 3 \\\\times 10$, and it is resolved at $N = 60$. From $N = 65$ to $69$, a similar issue arises, as $25 \\\\times 2 + 10 + 5 \\\\times 1$ is not as optimal as $25 + 4 \\\\times 10$ to approach 65.\\n\\nWe observe that this issue repeats in cycles of $25$ numbers, with $10$ of the $25$ numbers in each cycle not working. The cycle starts at $30$, and the next cycle will start $25$ numbers later, at $55$, then $80$, and so on, continuing until $980$\u2013$1005$ for the last cycle.\\n\\nThe total number of cycles is given by:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{955 - 30}{25} + 1 = 38,$$\\n\\nand each cycle contains $10$ problematic numbers. Therefore, the total number of problematic numbers is:\\n\\n$$38 \\\\times 10 = 380.$$\\n\\nThe cycle from $980$ to $1005$ has the problematic numbers from $980$ to $984$ and $990$ to $994$, giving another $10$ problematic numbers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of unsuccessful numbers from $1$ to $1000$ inclusive is $390$, and the desired count of successful numbers is:\\n\\n$$1000 - 390 = \\\\boxed{610}.$$\nThe final answer is \\boxed{610}.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nLet $S$ be the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ with $1 \\\\leq a \\\\leq 100$ and $b \\\\geq 0$ such that the polynomial $x^2+ax+b$ can be factored into the product of two (not necessarily distinct) linear factors with integer coefficients.

We can see that the pattern is: \\n\\n- $3^1$ has the digits $3$ in base $143$.\\n- $3^2$ has the digits $1$ in base $143$.\\n- $3^3$ has the digits $3$ in base $143$.\\n- $3^4$ has the digits $0$ in base $143$.\\n- $3^5$ has the digits $0$ in base $143$.\\n- $3^6$ has the digits $1$ in base $143$.\\n\\nSo, we can see that the pattern repeats every $3$ powers. We can also see that the pattern starts with $3^1$ and ends with $3^6$. So, we can find the least positive integer $n$ such that $3^{n+3} = 3^n + 3^n + 3^n$. This is equivalent to $3^{n+3} = 3^{n+1}(3^n+3^n+3^n)$.\\n\\nNow, we can see that $3^n+3^n+3^n = 3^n(1+1+3)$. Since $1+1+3 = 2+2+1 = 5$, we can see that $3^n+3^n+3^n$ is always a multiple of $3^n$. So, $3^{n+3} = 3^{n+1}3^n(3^n+3^n+3^n)$ is always a multiple of $3^{n+1}3^n$. This means that $3^{n+1}$ and $3^n$ must divide $3^{n+3}$.\\n\\nNow, we can see that $3^n$ and $3^{n+1}$ are always distinct powers of $3$. So, $3^{n+1}$ cannot divide $3^{n+3}$. This means that $3^n$ must divide $3^{n+3}$.\\n\\nWe can see that $3^n$ can only divide $3^{n+3}$ if $n+3$ is a multiple of $n$. This is equivalent to $n(n+3)$ being a multiple of $n$. Since $n(n+3)$ is always a multiple of $n+3$, we can see that $n$ must be a multiple of $n+3$. This means that $n$ must be a multiple of $6$. So, we can find the least positive integer $n$ such that $3^{n+6} = 3^n + 3^n + 3^n$. This is equivalent to $3^{n+6} = 3^{n+3}(3^{n+3}+3^{n+3}+3^{n+3})$.\\n\\nNow, we can see that $3^{n+3}+3^{n+3}+3^{n+3}$ is always a multiple of $3^{n+3}$. So, $3^{n+6}$ is always a multiple of $3^{n+3}$. This means that $3^{n+3}$ must divide $3^{n+6}$.\\n\\nWe can see that $3^{n+3}$ can only divide $3^{n+6}$ if $n+6$ is a multiple of $n+3$. This is equivalent to $n(n+3)$ being a multiple of $(n+3)$. Since $n(n+3)$ is always a multiple of $n+3$, we can see that $n$ must be a multiple of $n+3$.

Similarly, for $4x+y=0$, we need $y$ to be a multiple of $4$. This means that $y$ must be a multiple of $12$ and $24$, respectively.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the first case, $3x-y=0$.

Denote the odd numbered positions to be $a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7$ and the even numbered positions to be $a_2, a_4, a_6$ (recall $a_8=2$).

            "SOLUTION_TEXT": "##Solution 1\\n\\nNote that order does not matter here. This is because any permutation of the $6$ pairs will automatically get ordered in alphabetical order. The same is true for within each of the pairs. In other words, AB CH DI EJ FK GL should be counted equally as HC AB DI EJ FK GL.\\n\\nWe construct two cases: $G$ is the first letter of the last word and $G$ is the second letter of the last word.\\n\\nOur first case is when $G$ is the first letter of the last word. Then the second letter of the last word must be one of $H, I, J, K, L$. Call that set of $5$ letters $\\\\Omega$. There are $5$ ways to choose the second letter from $\\\\Omega$. The other $4$ letters of $\\\\Omega$ must be used in the other $5$ words.\\n\\nFor the other 5 words, each of their first letters must be before $G$ in the alphabet. Otherwise, the word with $G$ will not be the last. There are $6$ letters before $G$: $A,B,C,D,E,F$. Call that set of $6$ letters $\\\\Sigma$. Exactly one of the words must have two letters from $\\\\Sigma$. The other 4 will have their first letter from $\\\\Sigma$ and the second letter from $\\\\Omega$. There are $4!$ ways to determine the possible pairings of letters from $\\\\Sigma$ and $\\\\Omega$, respectively.\\n\\nTherefore, this case has $5 \\\\cdot {6\\\\choose{2}} \\\\cdot 4! = 5 \\\\cdot 15 \\\\cdot 24 = 1800$ orderings.\\n\\nThe second case is when $G$ is the second letter of the last word. You can see that the first letter of that word must be $F$. Otherwise, that word cannot be the last word. The other $5$ words must start with $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The second letter of each of those words will come from $\\\\Omega$. There will be $5!$ ways to distribute the elements of $\\\\Omega$ to one of $A, B, C, D, E$. There are therefore $5! = 120$ orderings in the case.\\n\\nIn total, there are $1800+120 = 1920$ orderings. However, we want the probability. The number of ways to put the $12$ letters into pairs is $11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1$. This is true because we can say this: Start with $A$. It has $11$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $10$ letters left. Pick one of those letters. It has $9$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $8$ letters left. Continue until there are only $2$ letters left, and there is only $1$ option for that last word. Therefore, there will be $11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1$ options.\\n\\nThe probability is therefore $\\\\frac{1920}{11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1} = \\\\frac{128}{693}$.
