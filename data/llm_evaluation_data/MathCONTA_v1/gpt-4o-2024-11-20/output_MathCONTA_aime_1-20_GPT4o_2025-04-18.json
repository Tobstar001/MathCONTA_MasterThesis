This means the roots of the polynomial must be integers.\n\n### Step 1: Factorization condition\nThe polynomial \\(x^2 + ax + b\\) can be factored as:\n\\[\nx^2 + ax + b = (x - p)(x - q),\n\\]\nwhere \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are integers. Expanding this factorization gives:\n\\[\nx^2 + ax + b = x^2 - (p + q)x + pq.\n\\]\nBy comparing coefficients, we see that:\n\\[\na = -(p + q) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = pq.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Range of \\(a\\)\nFrom the problem, \\(1 \\leq a \\leq 100\\). Since \\(a = -(p + q)\\), this implies:\n\\[\np + q = -a.\n\\]\nThus, \\(p + q\\) must be a negative integer in the range \\([-100, -1]\\).\n\n### Step 3: Express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nThe value of \\(b\\) is given by \\(b = pq\\). For each fixed value of \\(p + q = -a\\), we need to count the number of integer pairs \\((p, q)\\) such that \\(p + q = -a\\) and \\(b = pq \\geq 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nLet \\(p = k\\). Then \\(q = -a - k\\), and we have:\n\\[\nb = pq = k(-a - k) = -ak - k^2.\n\\]\nFor \\(b \\geq 0\\), we require:\n\\[\n-ak - k^2 \\geq 0.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(-k\\) (since \\(k \\neq 0\\)):\n\\[\n-ak - k^2 = -k(a + k) \\geq 0.\n\\]\nThis inequality holds if and only if:\n\\[\nk \\leq 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k \\geq -a.\n\\]\nThus, \\(k\\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n-a \\leq k \\leq 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Count the number of valid \\(k\\) values\nThe integers \\(k\\) satisfying \\(-a \\leq k \\leq 0\\) are:\n\\[\nk = -a, -a + 1, \\dots, -1, 0.\n\\]\nThe total number of such \\(k\\) values is:\n\\[\n0 - (-a) + 1 = a + 1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Total number of pairs \\((a, b)\\)\nFor each fixed \\(a\\) in the range \\(1 \\leq a \\leq 100\\), there are \\(a + 1\\) valid pairs \\((p, q)\\), and hence \\(a + 1\\) valid values of \\(b\\). Summing over all \\(a\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(100\\), the total number of pairs \\((a, b)\\) is:\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{a=1}^{100} (a + 1).\n\\]\nSimplify the sum:\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{a=1}^{100} a + \\sum_{a=1}^{100} 1.\n\\]\nThe first term is the sum of the first 100 positive integers:\n\\[\n\\sum_{a=1}^{100} a = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050.\n\\]\nThe second term is the sum of 100 ones:\n\\[\n\\sum_{a=1}^{100} 1 = 100.\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nS = 5050 + 100 = 5150.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find the remainder when \\(S\\) is divided by 1000\nFinally, compute the remainder of \\(S = 5150\\) when divided by 1000:\n\\[\n5150 \\mod 1000 = 150.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{150}\n\\]",

Kathy is happy if and only if all the red cards in the row are adjacent and all the green cards in the row are adjacent. This means the row must consist of either all red cards (RRRRR) or all green cards (GGGGG).\n\nWe are tasked with finding the probability that Kathy will be happy, expressed as a fraction \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime positive integers. We then compute \\( m + n \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Choose and Arrange 5 Cards\n\nKathy has 10 cards in total, and she selects 5 of them to lay out in a row. The total number of ways to choose 5 cards from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!} = 252.\n\\]\nFor each selection of 5 cards, there are \\( 5! = 120 \\) ways to arrange them in a row. Thus, the total number of possible arrangements of 5 cards is:\n\\[\n252 \\cdot 120 = 30240.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Number of \"Happy\" Arrangements\n\nKathy is happy if all the red cards in the row are adjacent and all the green cards in the row are adjacent. This means the row must consist of either all red cards (RRRRR) or all green cards (GGGGG).\n\n#### Case 1: All Red Cards (RRRRR)\nTo form a row of 5 red cards, Kathy must select all 5 red cards from the 10 cards. There is only **1 way** to choose all 5 red cards, and there is only **1 way** to arrange them in a row. Thus, there is exactly **1 arrangement** for this case.\n\n#### Case 2: All Green Cards (GGGGG)\nSimilarly, to form a row of 5 green cards, Kathy must select all 5 green cards from the 10 cards. There is only **1 way** to choose all 5 green cards, and there is only **1 way** to arrange them in a row. Thus, there is exactly **1 arrangement** for this case.\n\n#### Total Number of Happy Arrangements\nAdding the two cases together, the total number of \"happy\" arrangements is:\n\\[\n1 + 1 = 2.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Probability of a \"Happy\" Arrangement\n\nThe probability that Kathy will be happy is the ratio of the number of \"happy\" arrangements to the total number of arrangements:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Happy Arrangements}}{\\text{Total Number of Arrangements}} = \\frac{2}{30240}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{30240} = \\frac{1}{15120}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe probability that Kathy will be happy is \\( \\frac{1}{15120} \\). Here, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 15120 \\), so:\n\\[\nm + n = 1 + 15120 = 15121.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15121}.\n\\]",

            "LLM_RESPONSE": "### Problem Analysis\n\nWe are tasked with finding the number of isosceles triangles (including equilateral triangles) that can be formed by choosing 3 vertices from a right hexagonal prism. The prism has height \\(2\\), and its bases are regular hexagons with side length \\(1\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of the prism\n\nThe prism has two hexagonal bases, one on the top and one on the bottom. Each hexagon has 6 vertices, so there are \\(6 + 6 = 12\\) vertices in total. Let the vertices of the top hexagon be \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_6\\) (in clockwise order), and the vertices of the bottom hexagon be \\(B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_6\\) (in clockwise order). The vertices \\(A_i\\) and \\(B_i\\) are directly aligned vertically.\n\n### Step 2: Total number of triangles\n\nThe total number of triangles that can be formed by choosing any 3 vertices from the 12 vertices is:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10}{6} = 220.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for isosceles triangles\n\nA triangle is isosceles if at least two of its sides are equal. To count the number of isosceles triangles, we will consider the different ways the vertices can be chosen and check whether the resulting triangle is isosceles.\n\n### Step 4: Categorizing the triangles\n\nWe categorize the triangles based on how the vertices are chosen:\n1. **All three vertices are from the same hexagonal base (top or bottom).**\n2. **Two vertices are from one base, and the third vertex is from the other base.**\n3. **All three vertices are from different vertical edges (one vertex from each of three vertical edges).**\n\n#### Case 1: All three vertices are from the same base\n\nEach hexagonal base is a regular hexagon with side length \\(1\\). The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from one hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20.\n\\]\nSince there are two hexagonal bases (top and bottom), the total number of triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n20 + 20 = 40.\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many of these triangles are isosceles. In a regular hexagon:\n- Any triangle formed by three consecutive vertices is isosceles (e.g., \\(\\triangle A_1A_2A_3\\)).\n- Any triangle formed by two opposite vertices and one adjacent vertex is isosceles (e.g., \\(\\triangle A_1A_4A_2\\)).\n- Any triangle formed by three vertices that are evenly spaced around the hexagon is equilateral (e.g., \\(\\triangle A_1A_3A_5\\)).\n\nBy symmetry, we can count the isosceles triangles systematically:\n- There are 6 triangles formed by three consecutive vertices.\n- There are 6 triangles formed by two opposite vertices and one adjacent vertex.\n- There are 2 equilateral triangles.\n\nThus, there are \\(6 + 6 + 2 = 14\\) isosceles triangles per hexagon. Since there are two hexagons, the total number of isosceles triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n14 + 14 = 28.\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Two vertices from one base, and the third vertex from the other base\n\nWe choose 2 vertices from one hexagonal base and 1 vertex from the other base. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from one hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = 15.\n\\]\nThe number of ways to choose 1 vertex from the other hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{1} = 6.\n\\]\nThus, the total number of triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n15 \\cdot 6 = 90.\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many of these triangles are isosceles. For a triangle to be isosceles, the two vertices from the same base must be adjacent (since the base is a regular hexagon with side length \\(1\\), and the height of the prism is \\(2\\)). There are 6 pairs of adjacent vertices in each hexagon. For each such pair, there are 6 choices for the third vertex from the other base. Thus, the total number of isosceles triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 6 = 36.\n\\]\n\n#### Case 3: All three vertices are from different vertical edges\n\nIn this case, we choose one vertex from each of three different vertical edges. There are 6 vertical edges in the prism, and the number of ways to choose 3 edges is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20.\n\\]\nFor each choice of 3 edges, there are 2 choices for the vertex on each edge (top or bottom). Thus, the total number of triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n20 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 160.\n\\]\n\nNow, we determine how many of these triangles are isosceles. For a triangle to be isosceles, two of the vertices must be at the same height (both on the top or both on the bottom). There are 2 ways to choose which two vertices are at the same height, and for each such choice, there are 6 ways to choose the three edges. Thus, the total number of isosceles triangles in this case is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 6 = 12.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Adding up the results\n\nThe total number of isosceles triangles is the sum of the isosceles triangles from all three cases:\n\\[\n28 + 36 + 12 = 76.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{76}\n\\]",

This is because:\n- If \\(x + y = 16\\), then \\(x, y \\leq 15\\).\n- If \\(x + y = 24\\), then \\(x, y \\geq 4\\).\n\nThus, the four elements of the subset are uniquely determined by choosing one pair from the pairs that sum to \\(16\\) and one pair from the pairs that sum to \\(24\\).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the subsets\nThere are \\(8\\) pairs of numbers that sum to \\(16\\) and \\(9\\) pairs of numbers that sum to \\(24\\). Since the pairs are disjoint, we can independently choose one pair from the \\(8\\) pairs that sum to \\(16\\) and one pair from the \\(9\\) pairs that sum to \\(24\\).

We can count the number of left/right (L/R) paths of length $\\\\le 11$ that start at $S$ and end at either $P_4$ or $P_3$.\\n\\nWe can visualize the paths using the common grid counting method by starting at the origin $(0,0)$, so that a right (R) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $x$ direction, and a left (L) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $y$ direction. Because we don't want to move more than 2 units left or more than 3 units right, our path must not cross the lines $y = x+2$ or $y = x-3$. Letting $p(x,y)$ be the number of such paths from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$ under these constraints, we have the following base cases:\\n\\n$p(x,0) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & x \\\\le 3 \\\\\\\\ 0 & x > 3 \\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad p(0,y) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & y \\\\le 2 \\\\\\\\ 0 & y > 2 \\\\end{cases}$\\n\\nand recursive step $p(x,y) = p(x-1,y) + p(x,y-1)$ for $x,y \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nThe filled in grid will look something like this, where the lower-left $1$ corresponds to the origin:\\n\\n$\\\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\\\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\textbf{89} & & & \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\textbf{28} & 89 & & & \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 0 & \\\\textbf{9} & 28 & 61 & 108 & 155 & \\\\textbf{155} \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & \\\\textbf{3} & 9 & 19 & 33 & 47 & \\\\textbf{47} & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\textbf{1} & 3 & 6 & 10 & 14 & \\\\textbf{14} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & \\\\textbf{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 1 & 1 & 1 & \\\\textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular}$\\n\\nThe bolded numbers on the top diagonal represent the number of paths from $S$ to $P_4$ in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 moves, and the numbers on the bottom diagonal represent the number of paths from $S$ to $P_3$ in 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 moves.

The frog starts at vertex \\( S \\), and from any vertex except \\( E \\), it can jump to one of the two adjacent vertices. Once the frog reaches \\( E \\), it stops and stays there.\n\n### Step 1: Representing the Problem\nWe label the vertices of the heptagon as \\( S, P_1, P_2, P_3, E, P_4, P_5 \\) in clockwise order. Let \\( f_n(v) \\) represent the number of ways the frog can reach vertex \\( v \\) in exactly \\( n \\) jumps.

From \\( S \\), the frog can jump to \\( P_1 \\) or \\( P_5 \\).\n2. From \\( P_1 \\), the frog can jump to \\( S \\) or \\( P_2 \\).\n3.

The even digits among \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \\) are \\( 2, 4, 6, 8 \\).

The same is true for within each of the pairs. In other words, AB CH DI EJ FK GL should be counted equally as HC AB DI EJ FK GL.\\n\\nWe construct two cases: $G$ is the first letter of the last word and $G$ is the second letter of the last word.\\n\\nOur first case is when $G$ is the first letter of the last word. Then the second letter of the last word must be one of $H, I, J, K, L$. Call that set of $5$ letters $\\\\Omega$. There are $5$ ways to choose the second letter from $\\\\Omega$. The other $4$ letters of $\\\\Omega$ must be used in the other $5$ words.\\n\\nFor the other 5 words, each of their first letters must be before $G$ in the alphabet. Otherwise, the word with $G$ will not be the last. There are $6$ letters before $G$: $A,B,C,D,E,F$. Call that set of $6$ letters $\\\\Sigma$. Exactly one of the words must have two letters from $\\\\Sigma$. The other 4 will have their first letter from $\\\\Sigma$ and the second letter from $\\\\Omega$.

The second letter of each of those words will come from $\\\\Omega$. There will be $5!$ ways to distribute the elements of $\\\\Omega$ to one of $A, B, C, D, E$. There are therefore $5! = 120$ orderings in the case.\\n\\nIn total, there are $1800+120 = 1920$ orderings. However, we want the probability. The number of ways to put the $12$ letters into pairs is $11 \\\\cdot 9 \\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 1$. This is true because we can say this: Start with $A$.

            "LLM_RESPONSE": "### Problem Analysis\n\nWe are tasked with finding the probability that the last word in a list of six two-letter words contains the letter \\( G \\). The letters \\( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \\) are randomly grouped into six pairs, and the two letters in each pair are arranged alphabetically to form two-letter \"words.\" These words are then listed alphabetically.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of pairings\nThe total number of ways to group 12 letters into six pairs is given by the formula for the number of ways to partition \\( 2n \\) objects into \\( n \\) pairs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total pairings} = \\frac{(12)!}{2^6 \\cdot 6!}.\n\\]\nHere:\n- \\( (12)! \\) accounts for all permutations of the 12 letters.\n- \\( 2^6 \\) accounts for the fact that the order of letters within each pair does not matter.\n- \\( 6! \\) accounts for the fact that the order of the six pairs does not matter.\n\nThus, the total number of pairings is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total pairings} = \\frac{479,001,600}{64 \\cdot 720} = 103,095,000.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Favorable outcomes\nWe now focus on the condition that the last word in the alphabetical list contains the letter \\( G \\). For this to happen, the last word must be the lexicographically largest word among the six two-letter words. This means that the last word must contain \\( G \\) paired with the lexicographically largest letter available.\n\n#### Step 2.1: Pairing \\( G \\) with the largest letter\nThe largest letter in the set is \\( L \\). For \\( G \\) to appear in the last word, it must be paired with \\( L \\), forming the word \\( GL \\). This ensures that \\( GL \\) is the lexicographically largest word, as \\( G < L \\).\n\n#### Step 2.2: Forming the remaining five pairs\nAfter pairing \\( G \\) with \\( L \\), we are left with the remaining 10 letters: \\( A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K \\). These 10 letters must be grouped into five pairs. The number of ways to do this is:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining pairings} = \\frac{(10)!}{2^5 \\cdot 5!}.\n\\]\nHere:\n- \\( (10)! \\) accounts for all permutations of the 10 letters.\n- \\( 2^5 \\) accounts for the fact that the order of letters within each pair does not matter.\n- \\( 5! \\) accounts for the fact that the order of the five pairs does not matter.\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Remaining pairings} = \\frac{3,628,800}{32 \\cdot 120} = 94,080.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.3: Total favorable outcomes\nSince \\( G \\) must be paired with \\( L \\), and the remaining 10 letters can be grouped into pairs in \\( 94,080 \\) ways, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable outcomes} = 94,080.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Probability calculation\nThe probability that the last word contains \\( G \\) is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total pairings}} = \\frac{94,080}{103,095,000}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{94,080}{103,095,000} = \\frac{392}{42925}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the fraction\nThe numerator and denominator are relatively prime, so the fraction is already in its simplest form. Thus:\n\\[\nm = 392, \\quad n = 42925, \\quad m+n = 392 + 42925 = 43317.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{43317}\n\\]",

We organize them based on the powers of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\):\n\n| \\( a \\) (power of \\( 3 \\)) | \\( b = 0 \\) | \\( b = 1 \\) | \\( b = 2 \\) |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| \\( 0 \\)                    | \\( 1 \\)    | \\( 5 \\)    | \\( 25 \\)   |\n| \\( 1 \\)                    | \\( 3 \\)    | \\( 15 \\)   | \\( 75 \\)   |\n| \\( 2 \\)                    | \\( 9 \\)    | \\( 45 \\)   | \\( 225 \\)  |\n| \\( 3 \\)                    | \\( 27 \\)   | \\( 135 \\)  | \\( 675 \\)  |\n| \\( 4 \\)                    | \\( 81 \\)   | \\( 405 \\)  | \\( 2025 \\) |\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Divisors required in \\( B \\)\n#### Divisors of the form \\( 3^4 \\cdot 5^b \\):\nThese divisors are:\n\\[\n3^4 \\cdot 5^0 = 81, \\quad 3^4 \\cdot 5^1 = 405, \\quad 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 = 2025.\n\\]\nThus, \\( B \\) must contain at least one of \\( \\{81, 405, 2025\\} \\).\n\n#### Divisors of the form \\( 3^a \\cdot 5^2 \\):\nThese divisors are:\n\\[\n3^0 \\cdot 5^2 = 25, \\quad 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 = 75, \\quad 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 225, \\quad 3^3 \\cdot 5^2 = 675, \\quad 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 = 2025.\n\\]\nThus, \\( B \\) must contain at least one of \\( \\{25, 75, 225, 675, 2025\\} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Total subsets of \\( A \\)\nThe total number of subsets of \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\n2^{15}.\n\\]\nThe number of subsets that are **empty** is \\( 1 \\). Thus, the number of **nonempty subsets** is:\n\\[\n2^{15} - 1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Subsets that satisfy the LCM condition\n#### Step 6.1: Subsets that do not contain any divisor of \\( 3^4 \\cdot 5^b \\)\nIf \\( B \\) does not contain any divisor of \\( 3^4 \\cdot 5^b \\), then \\( B \\) cannot satisfy the LCM condition. The number of divisors of \\( 3^4 \\cdot 5^b \\) is \\( 3 \\) (\\( \\{81, 405, 2025\\} \\)), so the remaining divisors are \\( 15 - 3 = 12 \\). The total number of subsets of these 12 divisors is:\n\\[\n2^{12}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6.2: Subsets that do not contain any divisor of \\( 3^a \\cdot 5^2 \\)\nIf \\( B \\) does not contain any divisor of \\( 3^a \\cdot 5^2 \\), then \\( B \\) cannot satisfy the LCM condition. The number of divisors of \\( 3^a \\cdot 5^2 \\) is \\( 5 \\) (\\( \\{25, 75, 225, 675, 2025\\} \\)), so the remaining divisors are \\( 15 - 5 = 10 \\).

The divisors of \\( 3^4 \\cdot 5^b \\) and \\( 3^a \\cdot 5^2 \\) together are:\n\\[\n\\{81, 405, 2025, 25, 75, 225, 675\\}.\n\\]\nThis is a total of \\( 3 + 5 - 1 = 7 \\) divisors (note that \\( 2025 \\) is double-counted). The remaining divisors are \\( 15 - 7 = 8 \\). The total number of subsets of these 8 divisors is:\n\\[\n2^8.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6.4: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nUsing inclusion-exclusion, the number of subsets that do not satisfy the LCM condition is:\n\\[\n2^{12} + 2^{10} - 2^8.\n\\]\n\nThe number of subsets that **do** satisfy the LCM condition is:\n\\[\n(2^{15} - 1) - (2^{12} + 2^{10} - 2^8).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Probability\nThe probability that a randomly selected subset \\( B \\) satisfies the LCM condition is:\n\\[\n\\frac{(2^{15} - 1) - (2^{12} + 2^{10} - 2^8)}{2^{15} - 1}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\\[\n2^{15} - 1 - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8 = 2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8 - 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8 - 1}{2^{15} - 1}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Simplify and find \\( m + n \\)\nLet \\( 2^{15} = 32768 \\), \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\), \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\), and \\( 2^8 = 256 \\). Substituting these values:\n\\[\n2^{15} - 2^{12} - 2^{10} + 2^8 - 1 = 32768 - 4096 - 1024",

            "LLM_RESPONSE": "### Problem Analysis\n\nWe are tasked with determining how many values of \\( N \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq N \\leq 1000 \\)) allow the greedy algorithm to succeed in finding the minimum number of coins to make \\( N \\) cents using \\( 1 \\)-cent, \\( 10 \\)-cent, and \\( 25 \\)-cent coins.\n\nThe **greedy algorithm** works as follows:\n1. Use as many \\( 25 \\)-cent coins as possible without exceeding \\( N \\).\n2. Use as many \\( 10 \\)-cent coins as possible with the remaining amount.\n3. Use \\( 1 \\)-cent coins to make up the rest.\n\nThe greedy algorithm succeeds for a given \\( N \\) if no other combination of coins uses fewer coins than the greedy solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Conditions for the Greedy Algorithm to Fail\n\nThe greedy algorithm fails for a given \\( N \\) if there exists a combination of coins that uses fewer coins than the greedy solution. This typically happens when the greedy algorithm overuses larger coins (e.g., \\( 25 \\)-cent coins) and fails to minimize the total number of coins.\n\n#### Key Observation:\nThe greedy algorithm fails if and only if there exists a combination of coins that achieves the same total \\( N \\) but uses fewer coins than the greedy solution. This failure occurs when the greedy algorithm does not account for the optimal trade-off between \\( 25 \\)-cent and \\( 10 \\)-cent coins.\n\n#### Example of Failure:\nFor \\( N = 30 \\):\n- The greedy algorithm chooses \\( 1 \\) \\( 25 \\)-cent coin and \\( 5 \\) \\( 1 \\)-cent coins, for a total of \\( 6 \\) coins.\n- However, the optimal solution is \\( 3 \\) \\( 10 \\)-cent coins, which uses only \\( 3 \\) coins.\n- Thus, the greedy algorithm fails for \\( N = 30 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: General Conditions for Failure\n\nTo determine when the greedy algorithm fails, we analyze the relationship between \\( N \\), \\( 25 \\)-cent coins, and \\( 10 \\)-cent coins.\n\n#### Case 1: \\( N \\mod 25 \\leq 10 \\)\nIf the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by \\( 25 \\) is less than or equal to \\( 10 \\), the greedy algorithm succeeds. This is because the greedy algorithm will use the correct number of \\( 25 \\)-cent coins, and the remaining amount can be made optimally using \\( 10 \\)-cent and \\( 1 \\)-cent coins.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( N \\mod 25 > 10 \\)\nIf the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by \\( 25 \\) is greater than \\( 10 \\), the greedy algorithm may fail. This is because the greedy algorithm might overuse \\( 25 \\)-cent coins, leaving a remainder that could have been made more efficiently using \\( 10 \\)-cent coins.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Counting Values of \\( N \\) Where the Greedy Algorithm Succeeds\n\n#### Step 3.1: Analyze \\( N \\mod 25 \\)\nThe possible remainders when \\( N \\) is divided by \\( 25 \\) are \\( 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 24 \\). For each remainder:\n- If \\( N \\mod 25 \\leq 10 \\), the greedy algorithm succeeds.\n- If \\( N \\mod 25 > 10 \\), the greedy algorithm may fail.\n\n#### Step 3.2: Count Successful Cases for Each Block of \\( 25 \\)\nIn each block of \\( 25 \\) consecutive integers (e.g., \\( 1 \\) to \\( 25 \\), \\( 26 \\) to \\( 50 \\), etc.), there are \\( 11 \\) values of \\( N \\) where \\( N \\mod 25 \\leq 10 \\).
